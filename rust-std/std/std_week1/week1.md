### Week 1: Primitive Types and Traits

We'll partition this week into five entries, each focusing on specific aspects of primitive types and traits in Rust. Here's the outline for our entries:

1. **Entry 1: Introduction to Primitive Types**
2. **Entry 2: Understanding and Using Traits**
3. **Entry 3: Common Traits in Rust**
4. **Entry 4: Implementing Custom Traits**
5. **Entry 5: Practical Exercises and Applications**

---

### **Entry 1: Introduction to Primitive Types**

**Objective:** Understand the basic primitive types in Rust and their characteristics.

#### **Primitive Types Overview**

Rust has several built-in primitive types, which are the most basic data types in the language. The main categories include:

1. **Integers**: Signed and unsigned integer types (e.g., `i32`, `u8`).
2. **Floating-point numbers**: Types for decimal values (e.g., `f32`, `f64`).
3. **Boolean**: Represents true or false values (`bool`).
4. **Character**: A single Unicode character (`char`).
5. **Tuple**: A fixed-size collection of values of different types.

#### **Common Primitive Types**

| Type   | Description                       | Size (bytes) | Example     |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `i8`   | Signed 8-bit integer              | 1            | `let x: i8 = 5;` |
| `i32`  | Signed 32-bit integer             | 4            | `let y: i32 = -10;` |
| `u8`   | Unsigned 8-bit integer            | 1            | `let z: u8 = 255;` |
| `f32`  | 32-bit floating point             | 4            | `let a: f32 = 3.14;` |
| `f64`  | 64-bit floating point             | 8            | `let b: f64 = 2.71828;` |
| `bool` | Boolean type                     | 1            | `let is_active: bool = true;` |
| `char` | Single character                 | 4            | `let letter: char = 'A';` |

#### **Example Code: Working with Primitive Types**

Here’s a simple example demonstrating the use of primitive types in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer Types
    let signed_integer: i32 = -42;
    let unsigned_integer: u8 = 200;
    
    // Floating-point Types
    let pi: f64 = 3.14159;
    let epsilon: f32 = 0.00001;

    // Boolean Type
    let is_rust_fun: bool = true;

    // Character Type
    let first_letter: char = 'R';

    // Output the values
    println!("Signed Integer: {}", signed_integer);
    println!("Unsigned Integer: {}", unsigned_integer);
    println!("Pi: {}", pi);
    println!("Epsilon: {}", epsilon);
    println!("Is Rust fun? {}", is_rust_fun);
    println!("First Letter: {}", first_letter);
}
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **Integer Declaration**: Here, `signed_integer` is declared as `i32`, allowing it to store negative values, while `unsigned_integer` as `u8` can only hold positive values.
- **Floating-point Numbers**: `pi` is a `f64`, which provides higher precision than `f32`, stored in `epsilon`.
- **Boolean**: `is_rust_fun` is a `bool`, holding true or false.
- **Character**: `first_letter` is a `char`, holding a single character.

#### **Key Takeaways:**

- Rust provides a variety of primitive types that help you store and manipulate data efficiently.
- Understanding the characteristics of these types is essential for effective programming in Rust.

This entry serves as a foundational overview of primitive types in Rust. If you’re ready, we can move on to **Entry 2: Understanding and Using Traits**!


### **Entry 2: Understanding and Using Traits**

**Objective:** Learn what traits are in Rust and how they facilitate polymorphism and code reuse.

#### **What Are Traits?**

In Rust, a **trait** is a collection of methods that can be implemented for different types. Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages but also allow for default method implementations. They enable polymorphism, allowing you to write code that works with different data types in a unified way.

#### **Why Use Traits?**

- **Code Reusability**: Traits allow you to define common functionality that can be reused across different types.
- **Polymorphism**: You can write functions that accept any type implementing a specific trait, making your code flexible and extensible.
- **Encapsulation**: Traits help encapsulate behavior, promoting clean and organized code.

#### **Defining a Trait**

Here’s how to define a trait in Rust:

```rust
// Define a trait named `Speak`
trait Speak {
    // Method signature without implementation
    fn speak(&self);
}
```

#### **Implementing a Trait**

Once you’ve defined a trait, you can implement it for any type:

```rust
// Define a struct named `Dog`
struct Dog;

impl Speak for Dog {
    // Provide implementation for the `speak` method
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

// Define a struct named `Cat`
struct Cat;

impl Speak for Cat {
    // Provide implementation for the `speak` method
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}
```

#### **Using Traits**

You can now use the trait to call the `speak` method on different types:

```rust
fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    // Call the speak method for each type
    dog.speak(); // Output: Woof!
    cat.speak(); // Output: Meow!
}
```

### **Key Concepts**

- **Trait Definition**: Traits are defined using the `trait` keyword followed by method signatures.
- **Trait Implementation**: Types can implement traits using the `impl TraitName for TypeName` syntax.
- **Method Calls**: Once implemented, you can call the methods defined in the trait on instances of the types.

#### **Default Method Implementations**

Traits can also provide default method implementations. If a type implements a trait but doesn’t provide its own implementation, it will use the default one.

```rust
trait Greet {
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello!");
    }
}

struct Person;

impl Greet for Person {
    // Person uses the default greet implementation
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person;
    person.greet(); // Output: Hello!
}
```

### **Key Takeaways**

- Traits are a powerful way to define shared behavior across different types in Rust.
- They enable polymorphism and code reuse, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- You can define default implementations, allowing for flexibility in how traits are used.

This entry provides a comprehensive understanding of traits in Rust. If you’re ready, we can proceed to **Entry 3: Common Traits in Rust**!


### **Entry 3: Common Traits in Rust**

**Objective:** Explore the commonly used traits in Rust and understand their significance in programming with Rust.

#### **Overview of Common Traits**

Rust has several built-in traits that are frequently used in everyday programming. Understanding these traits can greatly enhance your ability to write idiomatic and efficient Rust code. Here are some of the most common traits:

1. **`Debug`**: Allows for formatting an instance of a type for debugging purposes.
2. **`Clone`**: Provides a way to create a duplicate of an instance of a type.
3. **`Copy`**: A marker trait that indicates types can be duplicated by copying (rather than moving).
4. **`PartialEq`**: Enables comparison between instances of a type for equality.
5. **`PartialOrd`**: Enables comparison between instances of a type for ordering.
6. **`Eq`**: A trait that signifies a type can be compared for equality, with the requirement that types implementing `Eq` must also implement `PartialEq`.
7. **`Ord`**: A trait for total ordering of types that also implements `PartialOrd`.

#### **Using Common Traits**

Let’s go through each of these traits with examples.

**1. Debug Trait**

The `Debug` trait is used for formatting output for debugging. You need to derive this trait to enable it for your struct.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    println!("{:?}", point); // Output: Point { x: 10, y: 20 }
}
```

**2. Clone Trait**

The `Clone` trait allows for creating a copy of an object.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

fn main() {
    let person1 = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
    };
    let person2 = person1.clone(); // Create a copy

    println!("Person 1: {}", person1.name); // Output: Alice
    println!("Person 2: {}", person2.name); // Output: Alice
}
```

**3. Copy Trait**

The `Copy` trait is used for types that can be copied simply by copying bits. Primitive types like integers and booleans implement `Copy` automatically.

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct Coordinates {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Coordinates { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let point_copy = point; // Implicitly copied

    println!("Point: ({}, {})", point_copy.x, point_copy.y); // Output: (1, 2)
}
```

**4. PartialEq Trait**

The `PartialEq` trait allows you to compare instances for equality.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq)]
struct Book {
    title: String,
}

fn main() {
    let book1 = Book {
        title: String::from("Rust Programming"),
    };
    let book2 = Book {
        title: String::from("Rust Programming"),
    };

    if book1 == book2 {
        println!("Books are equal!"); // Output: Books are equal!
    }
}
```

**5. PartialOrd Trait**

The `PartialOrd` trait enables partial ordering between types.

```rust
#[derive(PartialOrd, PartialEq)]
struct Score {
    value: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let score1 = Score { value: 85 };
    let score2 = Score { value: 90 };

    if score1 < score2 {
        println!("Score 1 is less than Score 2!"); // Output: Score 1 is less than Score 2!
    }
}
```

**6. Eq Trait**

The `Eq` trait indicates a type is equivalent to itself and implements `PartialEq`.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
struct User {
    id: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User { id: 1 };
    let user2 = User { id: 1 };

    assert_eq!(user1, user2); // No panic means they are equal
}
```

**7. Ord Trait**

The `Ord` trait provides total ordering for types implementing `PartialOrd`.

```rust
#[derive(PartialOrd, PartialEq, Eq, Ord)]
struct Item {
    weight: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let item1 = Item { weight: 10 };
    let item2 = Item { weight: 20 };

    if item1 < item2 {
        println!("Item 1 is lighter than Item 2!"); // Output: Item 1 is lighter than Item 2!
    }
}
```

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Common Traits**: Understanding `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, and `Ord` is essential for effective Rust programming.
- **Deriving Traits**: Use the `#[derive(...)]` attribute to automatically implement common traits for your structs.
- **Trait Implementations**: Traits enable you to define and enforce behaviors across different types, facilitating code reuse and polymorphism.

This entry covers common traits in Rust and their applications. If you're ready, we can move on to **Entry 4: Implementing Custom Traits**!


### **Entry 4: Implementing Custom Traits**

**Objective:** Learn how to create and implement custom traits in Rust, enabling you to define specific behaviors for your types.

#### **Defining a Custom Trait**

Creating a custom trait allows you to specify methods that types must implement. Here’s how to define a trait:

```rust
// Define a custom trait named `Animal`
trait Animal {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str; // Method signature
}
```

In this example, the `Animal` trait defines a method called `sound` that returns a string slice representing the sound the animal makes.

#### **Implementing the Custom Trait**

Once you’ve defined a trait, you can implement it for specific types. Here’s how to implement the `Animal` trait for different types:

```rust
// Define a struct for `Dog`
struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str {
        "Woof!"
    }
}

// Define a struct for `Cat`
struct Cat;

impl Animal for Cat {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str {
        "Meow!"
    }
}
```

In this code, both `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `Animal` trait, providing their own version of the `sound` method.

#### **Using the Custom Trait**

You can now use the custom trait in your main function to call the `sound` method on different types:

```rust
fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    // Call the sound method for each type
    println!("Dog: {}", dog.sound()); // Output: Dog: Woof!
    println!("Cat: {}", cat.sound()); // Output: Cat: Meow!
}
```

#### **Trait with Additional Methods**

You can also define methods with default implementations in your custom traits. This allows types to either use the default or override it with their own implementation.

```rust
trait Animal {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str; // Method signature

    // Default method implementation
    fn habitat(&self) -> &str {
        "unknown habitat"
    }
}

struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str {
        "Woof!"
    }

    // Override the default implementation
    fn habitat(&self) -> &str {
        "Domestic"
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    println!("Dog sound: {}", dog.sound()); // Output: Dog sound: Woof!
    println!("Dog habitat: {}", dog.habitat()); // Output: Dog habitat: Domestic
}
```

#### **Traits as Function Parameters**

You can use traits as function parameters, allowing for polymorphism. This means you can write functions that accept any type that implements a specific trait.

```rust
fn animal_sound<T: Animal>(animal: T) {
    println!("Animal makes sound: {}", animal.sound());
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    animal_sound(dog); // Output: Animal makes sound: Woof!
    animal_sound(cat); // Output: Animal makes sound: Meow!
}
```

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Custom Traits**: Defining your own traits allows you to specify shared behavior among different types.
- **Trait Implementations**: Types can implement traits with their own specific logic for the methods defined in the trait.
- **Default Implementations**: You can provide default behavior in traits that types can choose to override.
- **Polymorphism**: Traits can be used as parameters in functions, enabling you to write flexible and reusable code.

This entry provides a comprehensive understanding of how to implement custom traits in Rust. If you're ready, we can proceed to **Entry 5: Practical Exercises and Applications**!


### **Entry 5: Practical Exercises and Applications**

**Objective:** Apply the concepts learned about primitive types and traits through practical exercises and real-world applications.

#### **Exercise 1: Defining Custom Traits**

1. **Task**: Create a trait named `Vehicle` with methods `start` and `stop`. Implement this trait for two structs: `Car` and `Bicycle`.

2. **Example Solution**:

```rust
// Define the Vehicle trait
trait Vehicle {
    fn start(&self);
    fn stop(&self);
}

// Implement Vehicle for Car
struct Car {
    model: String,
}

impl Vehicle for Car {
    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Starting the car: {}", self.model);
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping the car: {}", self.model);
    }
}

// Implement Vehicle for Bicycle
struct Bicycle {
    brand: String,
}

impl Vehicle for Bicycle {
    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Starting the bicycle: {}", self.brand);
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping the bicycle: {}", self.brand);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car { model: String::from("Toyota") };
    let bicycle = Bicycle { brand: String::from("Giant") };

    car.start(); // Output: Starting the car: Toyota
    car.stop();  // Output: Stopping the car: Toyota

    bicycle.start(); // Output: Starting the bicycle: Giant
    bicycle.stop();  // Output: Stopping the bicycle: Giant
}
```

#### **Exercise 2: Using Traits in Functions**

1. **Task**: Write a function `check_vehicle` that takes a type implementing the `Vehicle` trait and calls its `start` and `stop` methods.

2. **Example Solution**:

```rust
fn check_vehicle<T: Vehicle>(vehicle: T) {
    vehicle.start();
    vehicle.stop();
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car { model: String::from("Honda") };
    let bicycle = Bicycle { brand: String::from("Trek") };

    check_vehicle(car);      // Output: Starting the car: Honda
                              //          Stopping the car: Honda

    check_vehicle(bicycle);  // Output: Starting the bicycle: Trek
                              //          Stopping the bicycle: Trek
}
```

#### **Exercise 3: Trait with Default Implementations**

1. **Task**: Extend the `Vehicle` trait to include a method `horn` that has a default implementation. Override this method in the `Car` struct to provide a custom sound.

2. **Example Solution**:

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn start(&self);
    fn stop(&self);
    
    // Default implementation for horn
    fn horn(&self) {
        println!("Beep!");
    }
}

impl Vehicle for Car {
    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Starting the car: {}", self.model);
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping the car: {}", self.model);
    }

    // Override the default horn method
    fn horn(&self) {
        println!("Honk! Honk!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car { model: String::from("Ford") };

    car.start(); // Output: Starting the car: Ford
    car.horn();  // Output: Honk! Honk!
    car.stop();  // Output: Stopping the car: Ford
}
```

#### **Real-World Application: Building a Simple Simulation**

1. **Task**: Build a simple simulation that models different types of vehicles. Each vehicle can start, stop, and make a sound. Use traits effectively to encapsulate shared behaviors.

2. **Example Solution**:

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn start(&self);
    fn stop(&self);
    fn horn(&self) {
        println!("Generic vehicle horn!");
    }
}

struct Car {
    model: String,
}

impl Vehicle for Car {
    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Starting the car: {}", self.model);
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping the car: {}", self.model);
    }

    fn horn(&self) {
        println!("Car horn: Beep Beep!");
    }
}

struct Motorcycle {
    model: String,
}

impl Vehicle for Motorcycle {
    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Starting the motorcycle: {}", self.model);
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping the motorcycle: {}", self.model);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car { model: String::from("Toyota") };
    let motorcycle = Motorcycle { model: String::from("Harley Davidson") };

    let vehicles: Vec<&dyn Vehicle> = vec![&car, &motorcycle];

    for vehicle in vehicles {
        vehicle.start();
        vehicle.horn();
        vehicle.stop();
    }
}
```

### **Week 1 Real-World Project Challenge: Vehicle Management System**

**Objective:** Develop a simplified vehicle management system using Rust that incorporates primitive types, traits, and custom implementations. This project will challenge you to apply your understanding of Rust's foundational concepts in a practical scenario.

#### **Project Overview**

Create a console-based application that manages different types of vehicles. The application should allow you to add vehicles, start them, stop them, and display their details. The system will use traits to define common behaviors for different vehicle types.

#### **Project Requirements**

1. **Define Traits:**
   - Create a trait named `Vehicle` with methods for `start`, `stop`, and `horn` (with a default implementation).

2. **Implement Vehicle Types:**
   - Create at least two vehicle types (e.g., `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bicycle`) implementing the `Vehicle` trait.
   - Each vehicle type should have attributes such as `model`, `brand`, or `number_of_wheels`.

3. **Vehicle Management:**
   - Implement a `VehicleManager` struct that can store a collection of vehicles.
   - Include methods to add vehicles, start all vehicles, stop all vehicles, and display the details of all vehicles.

4. **Main Functionality:**
   - In the `main` function, create instances of your vehicle types and add them to the `VehicleManager`.
   - Demonstrate starting, stopping, and displaying vehicle details through user interaction.

#### **Sample Structure**

```rust
// Define the Vehicle trait
trait Vehicle {
    fn start(&self);
    fn stop(&self);
    fn horn(&self) {
        println!("Generic vehicle horn!");
    }
}

// Implement Vehicle for Car
struct Car {
    model: String,
}

// Implement Vehicle for Motorcycle
struct Motorcycle {
    model: String,
}

// Define the VehicleManager struct
struct VehicleManager {
    vehicles: Vec<Box<dyn Vehicle>>, // Use a vector to hold dynamic vehicles
}

impl VehicleManager {
    fn new() -> Self {
        VehicleManager { vehicles: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_vehicle(&mut self, vehicle: Box<dyn Vehicle>) {
        self.vehicles.push(vehicle);
    }

    fn start_all(&self) {
        for vehicle in &self.vehicles {
            vehicle.start();
        }
    }

    fn stop_all(&self) {
        for vehicle in &self.vehicles {
            vehicle.stop();
        }
    }

    fn display_vehicles(&self) {
        for vehicle in &self.vehicles {
            // Here, you would print out the details of each vehicle.
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut manager = VehicleManager::new();

    let car = Box::new(Car { model: String::from("Toyota") });
    let motorcycle = Box::new(Motorcycle { model: String::from("Harley") });

    manager.add_vehicle(car);
    manager.add_vehicle(motorcycle);

    // Start and stop vehicles
    manager.start_all();
    manager.stop_all();
    // Display vehicle details
    manager.display_vehicles();
}
```

### **Challenge Tasks**

1. **Implement the `Vehicle` trait** with your own methods.
2. **Create at least two vehicle structs** and provide custom implementations for the `start`, `stop`, and `horn` methods.
3. **Develop the `VehicleManager`** struct to manage the collection of vehicles.
4. **Add functionality** to start all vehicles, stop all vehicles, and display their details.
5. **Enhance the user experience** by allowing user input to add vehicles and trigger actions (e.g., starting/stopping).

### **Outcome**

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with Rust's primitive types, traits, and struct management, reinforcing your foundational knowledge while creating a functional application.
