Rust is a systems programming language designed for performance, safety, and concurrency. Here are its key aspects:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model eliminates data races and enforces memory safety without a garbage collector. Borrowing and lifetimes ensure references are safe.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's design allows fearless concurrency with strong compile-time guarantees.
- **Performance**: Comparable to C/C++, Rust is optimized for speed and low-level access.
- **Tooling**: `cargo` is a powerful build system and package manager, simplifying dependency management and compilation.
- **Ecosystem**: With crates (Rust libraries), projects like WebAssembly, embedded systems, and networking are well-supported.
- **Error Handling**: Rust encourages handling errors through `Result` and `Option` types instead of exceptions.
- **Community**: The Rust community is known for its welcoming nature, fostering collaboration and extensive documentation.

Key features of Rust make it an excellent choice for developers aiming for performance while ensuring code safety.
