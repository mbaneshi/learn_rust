Here is a list of influential open-source applications built using Rust, demonstrating its impact across various domains:

1. **Servo** – An experimental web browser engine developed by Mozilla to test new approaches for rendering and browser architecture.
2. **TiKV** – A distributed transactional key-value database initially developed by PingCAP, offering strong consistency and high availability.
3. **Rust Analyzer** – A compiler front-end for Rust that improves code analysis and IDE integration, aiding in productivity.
4. **Rocket** – A high-level web framework known for ease of use and type safety, focusing on rapid development of web applications.
5. **Wasmer** – A WebAssembly runtime enabling lightweight containers, providing cross-platform execution.
6. **Amethyst** – A modular game engine, ideal for projects using the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
7. **WGPU** – A cross-platform graphics API that provides safe bindings to WebGPU and Vulkan, used in graphics applications.
8. **Exa** – A modern replacement for the Unix `ls` command, adding improved colorization and performance.
9. **Tokei** – A fast tool to count lines of code across large codebases, useful in code analysis and reporting.
10. **Citybound** – A work-in-progress, multiplayer city simulation game designed to explore city planning and resource management.
11. **Watchexec** – Monitors file changes and triggers commands, aiding development automation and rapid feedback loops.
12. **Bandwhich** – A terminal tool to track network bandwidth usage by process and connection.
13. **Coreutils (uutils)** – A Rust-based reimplementation of GNU core utilities for improved performance and portability.
14. **Xi-Editor** – A modern text editor that leverages Rust for its back-end, designed with performance and extensibility in mind.
15. **Skim** – A Rust-based fuzzy finder similar to `fzf`, enhancing terminal search efficiency.
16. **Fselect** – A tool that allows users to find files using SQL-like queries.
17. **Conduit** – A lightweight and secure service mesh for Kubernetes, improving microservice communication.
18. **Tauri** – A framework to build native desktop applications with a small footprint using web technologies.

These projects demonstrate Rust's versatility, from databases and web frameworks to tools, games, and graphics APIs.
