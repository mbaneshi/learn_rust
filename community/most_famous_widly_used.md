Some of the most popular and widely-used community packages in Rust include:

1. **Tokio** – A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous applications. It’s a cornerstone for Rust’s async ecosystem, enabling non-blocking I/O operations. With over 26,000 stars on GitHub, it's widely used for building networked services and applications.

2. **Serde** – A high-performance framework for serialization and deserialization. It allows easy data conversion between formats like JSON, YAML, and more. This package is especially valuable for applications needing structured data handling.

3. **Clap** – A command-line argument parser that makes building CLI tools simple and efficient. It is both beginner-friendly and robust, commonly used for utilities requiring flexible command-line interfaces.

4. **Anyhow** – A lightweight library for error handling, designed to simplify working with errors in Rust code. It is particularly popular for its easy integration with existing Rust error models【9†source】【10†source】.

These packages not only reflect Rust’s emphasis on safety and performance but also illustrate the strong community support for tools enabling both asynchronous operations and error management.
